"2","Why and How We Collect and Store Information Sally Ride Science collects and stores some information about your daughter or son, to allow her or him to participate in some activities. For example, we store and use email addresses and other contact information to communicate with users about contests and other special events. We request parent contact information and parent consent when a girl or boy participates in Sally Ride Science events and activities. This enables us to confirm that a parent consents to their daughter's or son's participation in an event or activity and agrees to the terms of our privacy policy.","Children"
"5","No Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information Sally Ride Science will not disclose or sell personally identifiable information (such as full name, email address, school, etc.) about your child without your prior consent. At this time, we would only disclose personally identifiable information about your daughter or son to a successor to our business or to a third party that helps us run Sally Ride Science events and activities (such as a company that hosts our website), but only if that party agrees to comply with our privacy policy and to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information. Should you not agree to this limited third party disclosure of your child's personally identifiable information, please contact the Sally Ride Science operator at the address below.","Children"
