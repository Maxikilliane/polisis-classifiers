# polisis-classifiers

This repository builds on the following code https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/Polisis_Benchmark to reproduce the results for privacy policy classification from Harkous et al. (2018).
It also contains the trained classifiers that can be used as they are and it also contains domain-specific word-embeddings.
